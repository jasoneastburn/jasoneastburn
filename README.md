<h1>Hello, nerds</h1>
<hr>
My name is Jason Eastburn and I am a Software Engineer in Kansas City, MO.  I enjoy designing and coding in a bunch of different technologies although I tend to gravitate towards Angular and mobile technologies.  As I build out projects that I can share, I will highlight them here on my profile.  You can always reach me on <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoneastburn">Twitter </a>.
